# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve GLP-1 Tracker! Please keep contributions focused and easy to review.

## Quick notes
- Use short, descriptive branch names (e.g., `fix/chart-tooltip`, `chore/ci-pipeline`).
- Keep PRs small and feature-scoped.
- Run checks locally before opening a PR:
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build`
